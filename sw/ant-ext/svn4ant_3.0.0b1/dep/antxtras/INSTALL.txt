INSTALLATION

1. Download and install all required Ant and dependent packages. Verify
   that each package is properly installed. AntXtras 3.x requires Ant
   version 1.8.x and JRE 1.5 (or later).

2. Download, verify, and extract a JWare/AntXtras distribution. The new
   user should download the binary distribution that includes a sample
   Ant script that can be used to verify your installation.

   * To verify the PGP signature of the downloaded archive, get the
     JWare distribution KEYS from http://purl.net/jware/KEYS

   * If you must manually generate all binaries for your environment,
     download the source-only distribution. The included "ez-build.xml"
     Ant build file can generate a default distribution from the source.
     Be sure you configure the "ez-build.properties" file for your
     environment. Read the AntXtras download web page for a list of 
     required third-party packages for compiling AntXtras.

3. Update your development and Ant run environment to include the main 
   AntXtras jar file in your ANT classpath. The required jar is found
   at <ANTXTRAS_HOME>/lib/jw-antxtras.jar.

4. Verify AntXtras classes are accessible in your ANT runtime environment.
   The easiest way to do this is to try loading the AntXtras antlib using
   a simple <taskdef> declaration; for example:
   <taskdef resource="org/jwaresoftware/antxtras/install/antlib.xml"/>

5. Read the AntXtras Overview on the website for a list of the most used
   antlib components and a set of quick-start examples.
