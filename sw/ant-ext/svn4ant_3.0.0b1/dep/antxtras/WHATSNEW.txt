                        JWare/AntXtras Foundation
                    Version 3.0.0b1, Release Apr 2010
                   -----------------------------------


This document contains the major AntXtras version change notes. For the most
recent information, visit the website at http://antxtras.sourceforge.net/.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This version of AntXtras represents a new series (v3) based on JRE 1.5 
and Ant 1.8. Due to some incompatible structural changes to certain Ant
components on which AntXtras depends, AntXtras v3 is not compatible
with Ant 1.7.x and requires JRE 1.5 or later to run (the JRE requirement
is ours not Ant's).

CHANGES IN 3.0.0b1:
-------------------

=> [INCOMPAT] Rebuilt against latest Ant 1.8 release and JRE 1.5 so
   you MUST use Ant 1.8 with AntXtras v3; use an existing v2 release if
   you need to stick with Ant 1.7.x or JRE 1.4. [FS#188]


=> [INCOMPAT] As part of the goal to get the core AntXtras antlib to
   500K in size, the following components have been moved to the advanced
   antlib (antlib-advanced.xml): <prefer>, <ruleset>, <ruledef>, 
   <tallyset>, <criteria>, <strings>, <dowhile>, <call>, <callforeach>,
   <doinline>, <captureoutput>, <copylogged>, <interpretlogged>, and
   <classloaderdef>. The following components are in the testing antlib
   (antlib-unit.xml): <printbundle> and <printenv>. [FS#146, FS#151]


=> [INCOMPAT] Renamed the AntXtras <matches> CONDITION to <ismatch> to
   prevent collision with new Ant 1.7 <matches> condition. The synonym
   assertion condition was also removed. [FS#223]


=> [INCOMPAT] Invalid property references are now logged at the verbose
   level not the warning level. You can force AntXtras to signal a script
   error for malformed property references by setting the project or system
   property 'jware.antxtras.defaults.haltiferror.malformedproperties.flag'
   to true. [FS#188]


=> [INCOMPAT] The old 'if' and 'unless' attributes of the nested elements
   of a <locals> declaration have been renamed 'true' and 'false' to
   reflect how they're interpreted-- the *value* is checked as a literal
   string, not as a property name as implied by the old if/unless name.
   The if/unless attributes now really reflect the traditional use of 
   these attribute as tests for property existence ONLY. [FS#239]

   EXAMPLE:
        <locals id="edited.state">
          <property name="_callcount" if="trace.enabled"/>
          <property name="MAXWAIT" true="${$p:.strict?on}"/>
        </locals>


=> [INCOMPAT] The following v1 aliases for various components have been
   removed: <foreach>, <rule>, <autorun>, <isnumeric>, and <manageuris>.
   Use the supported component names instead: <doforeach>, <ruleset>, 
   <doinline>, <isnumber>, and <managefuncuts>. [FS#105]


=> [INCOMPAT] Removed all v1 and v2 deprecated condition aliases and
   function shortcuts. Affected items include: <isallset>, <isanyset>,
   <isnoneset>, <antversion>, etc. Also removed deprecated msgid
   and msgid attributes from rules framework. [FS#151, FS#187]


=> [INCOMPAT] The <capturelogs> taskset now defaults its "splitentries"
   feature on. This new setting makes captured log files human readable
   and is the expected setting for the majority of use-cases for this
   component. For transient log capture done on behalf of interpreters
   (e.g. evaluating results of javadoc, javac, emma, tests, etc.) you 
   can turn the feature off explicitly. [FS#184]


=> As of 3.0.0b1, when defined, the recommended namespace prefix and 
   URI for AntXtras are 'oja:' and 'jwaresoftware.antxtras'.

   EXAMPLE: Load AntXtras antlib into the 'jwaresoftware.antxtras'
   namespace referenced by the 'oja:' prefix.

        <project xmlns:oja="jwaresoftware.antxtras"...>
          ...
          <taskdef uri="jwaresoftware.antxtras"
             resource="org/jwaresoftware/antxtras/install/antlib.xml"
             classpathref="antxtras.classpath"/>
          ...
          <oja:show message="Hello World!"/>


=> The following AntXtras components now support the new <local> 
   property mechanism in Ant 1.8: <do>, <isolate>, <overlay>, <dowhile>, 
   <doforeach>, <criteria>, and each of the types of inner tasksets 
   for a <domatch>. For each of these tasksets a new locals scope is
   created for the duration of the taskset execution. There is also
   a special caveat for the <isolate> taskset: if you define a <local>
   for a property that you've already marked as "allow to pass through"
   any new local value assignment will NOT pass through (because the
   local scope masks the assignment from the 'outer' isolate parent's
   scope). [FS#221]


=> Added support for a 'isempty' operation to both $list: and $map:
   function shortcuts. [FS#217]
   
   EXAMPLE:
        <do false="${$map:myproperties?isempty}">
          [work work work...]
        </do>


=> Fixed <matches> TASK to set the falsevariable to "true" if there is
   no match; was setting value to "false". [FS#220]


=> New function shortcuts added for 3.0.0b1: $dirname:, $literal:.
   [FS#213, FS#230]

   EXAMPLE:
     1. $dirname:
        <path id="deps.path">
          <fileset dir="${$dirname:${root.d}}/deps/main">
            [in/exclusions...]
          </fileset>
        </path>

     2. $literal:
        <echo message="STATUS:${$string:default.stat|$literal:FAIL}"/>
