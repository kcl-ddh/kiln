Kiln documentation
==================

Kiln is an open source multi-platform framework for building and
deploying complex websites whose source content is primarily
in XML. It brings together various independent software components,
with `Apache Cocoon`_ at their centre, into an integrated whole that
provides the infrastructure and base functionality for such sites.

Kiln is developed and maintained by a team at the `Department of
Digital Humanities`_ (DDH), Kingâ€™s College London. Over the past years
and versions, Kiln (formerly called `xMod`_) has been used to generate
more than 50 websites which have very different source materials and
customised functionality. Since DDH has in-house guidelines for using
`TEI P5`_ to create websites, Kiln makes use of certain TEI markup
conventions. However, it has been adapted to work on a variety of
flavours of TEI and other XML vocabularies, and has been used to
publish data held in relational databases.
