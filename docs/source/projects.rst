Projects using Kiln
===================

Over the past years and versions, Kiln has been used to generate more than 50
websites which have very different source materials and customised
functionality. Since DDH has in-house guidelines for using TEI P5 to create
websites, Kiln makes use of certain TEI markup conventions. However, it has
been adapted to work on a variety of flavours of TEI and other XML
vocabularies, and has been used to publish data held in relational databases.
